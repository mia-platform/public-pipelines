The goals of this repository is to provide to user reusable pipelines for different languages for building libraries
and Docker images to use in their projects and follow the best practicies for setting up comprehensive pipelines
for building a project, assessing its security, and keep track of its dependencies. You can see this as a starting
step for your Platform Engeneering team for setting up a comprehensive suite of tools for their pipelines that can be
easy to use, and meet regulatory compliance for your company.
