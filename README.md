and Docker images to use in their projects and follow the best practicies for setting up comprehensive pipelines
for building a project, assessing its security, and keep track of its dependencies. You can see this as a starting
step for your Platform Engeneering team for setting up a comprehensive suite of tools for their pipelines that can be
easy to use, and meet regulatory compliance for your company.
